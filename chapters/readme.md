# Non-breaking whitespace best practices

>* **In references to named parts of a document:**  
Chapter~12   Theorem~1.2  
Appendix~A   Table~\hbox{B-8}  
Figure~3   Lemmas 5 and~6.  
>* **Between a person's forenames and between multiple surnames:**  
Donald~E. Knuth   Luis~I. Trabb~Pardo  
Bartel~Leendert van~der~Waerden   Charles~XII  
but be careful of names like Charles Louis Xavier~Joseph de~la Vall\'ee~Poussin.  
>* **Between math symbols in apposition with nouns:**  
dimension~$d$ width~$w$ function~$f(x)$  
string~$s$ of length~$l$~  
but compare with  
string~$s$ of length $l$~or more.  
>* **Between symbols in series:**  
1,~2, or~3  
$a$,~$b$, and~$c$  
1,~2, \dots,~$n$.  
>* **When a symbol is a tightly bound object of a preposition:**  
of~$x$  
from 0 to~1  
increase $z$ by~1  
in common with~$m$. but compare  
of $u$~and~$v$.  
>* **When mathematical phrases are rendered in words:**  
equals~$n$ less than~$\epsilon$ (given~$X$)  
mod~2 modulo~$p^e$ for all large~$n$  
Compare is~15 with is 15~times the height.  
>* **When cases are being enumerated within a paragraph:**  
(b)~Show that $f(x)$ is (1)~continuous; (2)~bounded..
